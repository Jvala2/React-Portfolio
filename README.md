## Description

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/Liscense-MIT-blue.svg "License Badge")

I needed to keep ahead of the game and develop a higher tech portfolio using react

With this I was able to excercize my skills in using react as well as create some sort of boilerplate template for myself using React in the future.
